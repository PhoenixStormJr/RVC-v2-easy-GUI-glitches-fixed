# RVC-v2-easyGUI-glitches-fixed

YIKES, the original was completely taken down! I don't know where a new one is! Good thing I made this or RVC for Google Colab would've been lost to history!

RVC V2 glitches fixed. This is the exact same as Rejekts, but I fixed the glitches in his repository. It had many glitches that virtually made RVC-v2-easy-gui very broken and almost unusable. I'm not trying to infringe on copyright violations, just fix his glitches. Date of original: 4/20/24

Mine here (If there are any issues, report them on the [Issues](https://github.com/PhoenixStormJr/RVC-v2-easy-GUI-glitches-fixed/issues) tab. I have completed it and there are no glitches as far as I can tell. I have also added a few features. Not extremely important though.):
