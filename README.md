# RVC-v2-easyGUI-glitches-fixed

RVC V2 glitches fixed. This is the exact same as Rejekts, but I fixed the glitches in his repository. It had many glitches that virtually made RVC-v2-easy-gui very broken and almost unusable. I'm not trying to infringe on copyright violations, just fix his glitches. Date of original: 10/02/2024

Mine here (If there are any issues, report them on the [Issues](https://github.com/PhoenixStormJr/RVC-v2-easy-GUI-glitches-fixed/issues) tab. I have completed it and there are no glitches as far as I can tell. I have also added a few features. Not extremely important though.)

OH! I now have created a MINIMALIST version! This is the minimal version, that runs a lot faster!:

But my original is still here:

Here is a backup made by [Hev832](https://huggingface.co/Hev832) with even MORE features. Might be a bit advanced though: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UiYHNiQO9abKxShA4cgV1gwqHrWvx3Ml

# Prepare an RVC dataset:

I also forked [Ultimate Vocal Remover](https://github.com/Eddycrack864/UVR5-NO-UI?tab=readme-ov-file) to help polish up a dataset! The thing is, Ultimate Vocal Remover has like... HUNDREDS of models, and nobody really has time to test them all. **I TESTED EVERY SINGLE ONE!!!** I have a pipeline of the BEST models to use for voice separation: 

"MelBand Roformer | Vocals by Gabox" -> "MelBand Roformer | De-Reverb-Echo Fused by Sucial" -> "MelBand Roformer | Denoise-Debleed by Gabox" -> "MelBand Roformer | Vocals FV2 by Gabox" -> "kuielab_a_vocals.onnx" -> "kuielab_b_vocals.onnx" -> (Extreme model) "MelBand Roformer | Karaoke by Gabox" OR "UVR-MDX-NET_Crowd_HQ_1.onnx" -> (Extreme model) "MelBand Roformer | Aspiration Less Aggressive by Sucial"

Here is my Google Colab notebook of a fork of UVR:

# Noticed updates break the program

I've noticed Google Colab keeps updating Python and other packages. This keeps breaking RVC and I keep having to install old packages. This is a problem with the installation cell, but the others are just fine. I'm working on fixes for this, but please note, because I am a college student, I can only work on my days off. Still though, comments and error reports are appreciated!

(Off topic, Jesus loves you, and died for your sins. Don't listen to corrupt Mega Churches with all these rules, Jesus said in Matthew 22:38-40: "This is the great and first commandment. And a second like unto it is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Meaning LOVE is the only commandment. Please join Jesus's TRUE family (not the evil Jesus of Mega Churches) and join his love today! Jesus loves you, God Bless! ðŸ˜„)
