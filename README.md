# RVC-v2-easyGUI-glitches-fixed

RVC V2 glitches fixed. This is the exact same as Rejekts, but I fixed the glitches in his repository. It had many glitches that virtually made RVC-v2-easy-gui very broken and almost unusable. I'm not trying to infringe on copyright violations, just fix his glitches. Date of original: 10/02/2024

Mine here (If there are any issues, report them on the [Issues](https://github.com/PhoenixStormJr/RVC-v2-easy-GUI-glitches-fixed/issues) tab. I have completed it and there are no glitches as far as I can tell. I have also added a few features. Not extremely important though.)

OH! I now have created a MINIMALIST version! This is the minimal version, that runs a lot faster! Still working on it though...:

Here is a backup made by [Hev832](https://huggingface.co/Hev832) with even MORE features. Might be a bit advanced though: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UiYHNiQO9abKxShA4cgV1gwqHrWvx3Ml

# Noticed updates break the program

I've noticed Google Colab keeps updating Python and other packages. This keeps breaking RVC and I keep having to install old packages. This is a problem with the installation cell, but the others are just fine. I'm working on fixes for this, but please note, because I am a college student, I can only work on my days off. Still though, comments and error reports are appreciated!


If you want my original that wasn't minimalist, here it is:
