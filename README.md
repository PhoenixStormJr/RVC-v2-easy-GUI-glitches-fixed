# RVC-v2-easyGUI-glitches-fixed
RVC V2 glitches fixed. This is the exact same as Rejekts, but I fixed the glitches in his repository. It had many glitches that virtually made RVC-v2-easy-gui very broken and almost unusable. I'm not trying to infringe on copyright violations, just fix his glitches. Date of original: 4/20/24
